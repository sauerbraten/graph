# Graph <a href="http://goci.me/project/github.com/sauerbraten/graph"><img src="http://goci.me/project/image/github.com/sauerbraten/graph" /></a>

A thread-safe implementation of a graph data structure in Go. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type) for more information. This implementation is weighted, but undirected.

There is also a version of this package that supports storing values in the graph nodes so that the graph can be used as a data store: https://github.com/sauerbraten/graph-store

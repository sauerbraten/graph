# Graph

A thread-safe implementation of a graph data structure in Go. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type) for more information. This implementation is weighted, but undirected.

There is also a version of this package that supports storing values in the graph nodes so that the graph can be used as a data store: https://github.com/sauerbraten/graph-store

## Usage

	$ go get github.com/sauerbraten/graph/v2

	)
